cuisine","body":"The Dr House of lemon bars Did you read the title We re not taking just the juice and zest here there s an entire acerbic lemon inside these babies And after hearing a song that I haven t heard in years I think at least some of my lemon adoration can be explained Excited Thought so D Among the numerous records that my mother played as I was growing up my favourites were those by Neil Diamond The Mamas the Papas Joan Baez and Peter Paul Mary To this day I love them all No one has the soothing sultry voice of Neil Diamond the perfect harmonization of The Mamas the Papas or the heartfelt ache of Joan Baez And no song will be able to bring me to tears even in my 30 s the way Puff the Magic Dragon can I remember my mom crying whenever she heard that song even when I was still only six or seven When I asked her why she was crying she said because of time and how quickly it passes and how fast you re growing up You can imagine how traumatizing it was when my sister and I started college That first year of college I made sure that my CD collection included all of the artists I grew up with On one particularly stormy spring evening while studying cramming for finals the song Lemon Tree by Peter Paul Mary came on For some reason it acted like a release valve My roommate hoped off her loft bed I carefully removed myself from the wobbly please don t tip over papasan and we ran outside barefoot and crazy A few other girls from the dorm soon joined us and we just laughed and ran around like wild little children It was such an insignificant impromptu moment in time yet it was one of the best times of my life I don t think I d ever been able to just let go like that before or since Every year around this time when the air is stormy humid and bursting with promise I m taken back to that night and how excited and happy we all felt Yesterday the song Lemon Tree played on the radio and it was an audio slingshot back in time I could smell the rain feel the warm breeze and the promise of a wide open future It s amazing how music has the power to transport us so rapidly to an exact moment from the past Lemon Tree what a deliciously fabulous song I m sure it may have a little something to do with my lemon obsession One of my favourite recipes ever is Dorie Greenspan s tartest lemon tart Why Because it calls for the entire lemon juice zest skin everything It s every lemon lovers paradise So when I saw this recipe which also calls for the entire lemon of course I had to make it Now I know that some of you may be sick of lemon this and lemon that especially of lemon bars in general But these babies are a step nay a leap up from all the rest They re lemon x 100 lemon on speed lemon with no apologies the Dr House of lemons Because of that they re not for everyone Only the hard core lemon head will find these irresistible Others may be turned off by their twangy tart almost bitter aftertaste But fellow lemon worshipers you will fall head over heels in love after one bite and you may not want to ever go back to those other sweet demure bars The poor Lemon Tree lemons would have been more than happy to be reincarnated into this recipe Whole Lemon Bars adapted from David Lebovitz Crust ingredients 1 cup flour 1 4 cup sugar 1 4 teaspoon salt 8 tablespoons that s 1 stick of melted unsalted butter 1 4 teaspoon of pure almond extract Filling ingredients 1 lemon organic or unsprayed 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice 3 large eggs room temperature 4 teaspoons corn starch 1 4 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons of melted unsalted butter MethodPreheat the oven to 350\u00baF Line an 8 inch square pan with foil leaving a slight overhang around the edges Lightly spray and set aside Prepare the crust In a medium bowl mix the flour sugar salt melted butter and almond extract Stir just until the lumps are gone try not to over mix Smooth the batter into the bottom of the prepared pan Use lightly floured hands to press in into an even layer as possible Bake the crust for 20 25 minutes or until just beginning to turn golden brown Prepare the filling as the crust bakes Filling Slice the lemon in half remove the seeds and cut the lemon into chunks don t worry about making them uniform Put the chunks in a food processor or blender along with the sugar and lemon juice and let it run until the lemon is completely broken up Add the eggs corn starch salt and melted butter Blend until almost smooth It s ok to have a few visible bits of lemon When the crust comes out of the oven reduce the heat of the oven to 300\u00baF Pour the lemon filling over the hot crust and bake for 20 25 minutes or just until the filling stops jiggling and is barely set Remove from the oven place on a cooling rack and let cool completely Once cool use the foil overhang to gently lift the bars out of the pan Cut the bars into squares or rectangles Sift powdered sugar over the top just before serving if desired

perfect creme brulee","title":"How to cook perfect creme brulee Life and style how to cook perfect creme brulee","body":"At one time between the ages of seven and 12 I believe I was among the south east s foremost creme brulee experts In the 80s and early 90s it seemed to be on every dessert menu and if it was there I had to have it But even at that age I recognised that not all brulees were created equal The best had a crisp shell that shattered satisfyingly under my spoon and a rich smooth layer of custard beneath with just a whisper of vanilla Any softness on the top or graininess in the custard was not tolerated although as a professional I always cleaned the dish regardless Great was my childish joy when I learned that this dish was in fact British the usual story attributes it to Trinity College in Cambridge which boasts a dedicated branding iron in the shape of the college crest But in fact Jane Grigson suspicious of the late date 1860s given for this event in Florence White s Good Things in England uncovered a trail of recipes leading back to a 17th century manuscript book As she notes custards made from eggs and cream were a European commonplace at the time so it would be pitifully jingoistic to try and claim the entire thing for Queen and country but perhaps we might take the credit for the inspired addition of the caramel Which I think you ll agree is what really makes the dish Cream and eggs dairy to dream Mrs Raffald recipe creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake As the name suggests dairy of some sort is the key ingredient of creme brulee Claire Clark in her book Indulge and Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham in The Prawn Cocktail Years use double cream which makes sense as this is to be a thick custard Mary Berry goes for single instead in her Traditional Puddings and Desserts and Larousse Gastronomique a mixture of whipping cream and milk Heston Blumenthal sticks with just milk Claire s brulee has the best texture firm yet not in the least rubbery Mary s is I hate to say it slightly too liquid while Heston s perhaps because of the vast number of egg yolks he puts in is solid but rather jellied Larousse I will deal with later In fact Heston s brulee is so rich with eggs that I can t face going back for a second spoonful an unprecedented occurrence I think I could probably manage a good half of Claire s despite the nine yolks she puts in there like Lindsey and Simon s it s eggy but not overpoweringly sweet I prefer the creamier lighter flavour of Mary s brulee though so I decide to reduce the number of yolks and see whether I can achieve the same texture without such richness 3 seems about right for 300ml of cream Elizabeth Raffald s 1769 recipe reproduced in Jane Grigson s English Food uses egg whites as well as yolks beaten separately and added to the custard along with a spoonful of flour This gives her custard more body but a slightly off putting paste like texture and colour The sugar Mary Berry recipe creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake Everyone but Larousse uses caster sugar in their custards they go for icing sugar possibly because it dissolves more easily but it doesn t seem to make much difference in their case Mary and Larousse switch to demerara to top the brulees however which I like the slightly larger grains might not melt to such a smooth mirror like consistency but they stay nicely crunchy and give the top a distinctive burnt toffee flavour I need a happy medium between Heston s sickly 60g and Simon and Lindsey s parsimonious 1 tbsp after a little experimentation 15g for this amount of cream seems to work well The flavourings Heston Blumenthal recipe creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake Vanilla is of course the usual choice here Heston s three pods seem excessive he claims he serves this dish in espresso cups but it s so intensely flavoured that a teaspoon would seem a more appropriate vehicle Mrs Raffald uses lemon peel and orange flower water both of which are rather nice as ideas but have no place in the classic brulee Heston suggests jasmine tea infused in the hot milk before it s strained on to the egg yolks also pleasant although it does give the custard a slightly strange brownish tinge The method Claire Clark recipe creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake Most of the recipes I try Claire Clark Heston Mary Berry involve pouring hot milk or cream on to egg yolks and sugar mixing them together and then sticking the resulting custard in the oven for half an hour I can t believe how easy it is had I known creme brulee was so quick I d have gorged myself silly long ago But Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham have other ideas it seems that creme brulee is made differently these days they write disapprovingly Once upon a time one was instructed to make the custard in the traditional way cooked very gently in a pan until thick Of course they say it s easier to control the cooking time if one takes the easy way out but it does not give the same texture as the stove top method For their recipe then I heat the cream with a vanilla pod leave it to infuse for a while then pour it on to the egg yolks and sugar and return the whole lot to a pan and heat until it thickens to an almost jelly like consistency rather like in Mrs Raffald s recipe This is then ready to chill Simon and Lindsey describe the results as voluptuous but I think I prefer the light wobbliness of the baked versions Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham recipe creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake Larousse pique my interest by not bothering to heat the cream before whisking it into the eggs according to the instructions which I re read several times in the light of subsequent events the whole lot goes into the oven cold After 30 minutes no leeway given here they come out the consistency of creme anglaise Nor do they thicken at all during chilling I suspect a step may have been missed out of the English translation unless anyone can throw any light on this unusual method Baking and bruleeing Larousse Gastronomique s recipe creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake Of those brulees which make it into the oven temperatures range from 160C from Mary Berry to 100C for Larousse s culinary disaster Claire Clark s 150C with a cold water bain marie as opposed to the hot specified by Mary and Heston seems to work perfectly I m not quite sure why Mary butters her ramekins either she seems a practical lady so perhaps it makes them easier to clean Mary Larousse and Mrs Raffald call for the brulees to be grilled but if you have a blowtorch it s much easier to control the heat and because it s quicker you won t have to wait for the custard to cool again before serving the cool creaminess beneath the crunchy topping being surely one of the glories of this inspired dish Simon and Lindsey reckon spraying the sugar with water helps the caramelisation process but I find exactly the opposite I blame the blowtorch Perfect creme brulee Felicity s perfect creme brulee Photograph Felicity Cloake For some reason a bowl of custard isn t seen as an appropriate dessert for a grown adult but scorch the top and give it a French name and it

vanilla pod and then pour the cream on to the yolk and sugar mix stirring constantly to mix 3 Divide the mixture between the ramekins and pour cold water into the tin until it comes two thirds of the way up the ramekins Bake for about 40 minutes until the custard is set it should only wobble faintly when shaken Cool and then chill until cold 4 Scatter the tops of the cold brulees with demerara

Good Sweets ","body":"If someone offered you portable chocolate that could instantly be spread on bread fruit crackers and pastries how could you refuse Thus began my love affair with Nutella a European spread made of hazelnut butter and cocoa During my days at NYU I was at a make your own sandwich bar when I first tried Nutella with French bread What a revelation The chocolate oozed out of the nooks and crannies while the spread s smoothness contrasted the bread s crust I then saw that bagels were an excellent vehicle for Nutella So were pretzels And bananas And gummy bears Fascinated by this new condiment I bought myself a jar and finished it in one week I ve never met any food that does not taste better with a dollop of Nutella Sometimes the best way to enjoy Nutella is to take a spoonful and just plop it in your mouth According to Ferrero s website Nutella was created in the 1940s in the midst of a chocolate shortage Pietro Ferrero a pastry maker stretched chocolate by thinning it out with ground hazelnuts It became so popular that it s as ubiquitous in Europe as peanut butter is in the U S If you ignore the high sugar content Nutella actually has a nutritional profile similar to peanut butter Its fat comes from the nuts not the chocolate Nutella gets its flavor from cocoa solids rather than cocoa butter True nuts are high in fat But if you re going to be eating fat it might as well come from nuts rather than steaks According to Mort Rosenblum s Chocolate A Bittersweet Saga of Dark and Light a 13 ounce jar of Nutella contains 50 2 3 cup hazelnuts 1 1 2 cups skim milk enough cocoa to make it brown and a lot of sugar As much as I love Nutella today s commercial version is actually sugar that s flavored with hazelnuts and cocoa You can tell because sugar is first in the ingredient list And there s lots of added oil to make it spreadable The version that I make at home is truly chocolate flavored hazelnut butter I use 2 cups of hazelnuts rather than Ferrero s puny 2 3 cup This recipe is the same that I ve sent out in Blogging by Mail and that Nic of The Baking Sheet used for her Nutella biscotti If you love this original recipe and repost it please credit this site Technically recipes aren t copyrightable but the L A Times posted an eerily similar version Update For an even richer version try the second formula which has caramel powder and no added oil Unless you have a professional nut grinder it won t be as smooth as commercial Nutella but the flavor more than makes up for it Chocolate Hazelnut Spread easy version Yield about 12 ounces 1 1 2 cups 2 cups whole raw hazelnuts1 cup powdered sugar1 4 cup unsweetened cocoa powderup to 1 4 cup vegetable or nut oil1 2 tsp vanilla extract Preheat oven to 350 F Place hazelnuts in a single layer on a shallow baking pan Toast until the skins are almost black and the meat is dark brown about 15 minutes Stir the nuts halfway through baking to ensure an even color To get rid of the bitter skins wrap the cooled hazelnuts in a clean kitchen towel or paper towel Rub until most of the skins come off but don t worry if some remain Process nuts in a food processor scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally until they have liquefied about 5 minutes First you will get coarsely chopped nuts then a fine meal After a little while the nuts will form a ball around the blade and it will seem like you only have a solid mass Keep processing The heat and friction will extract the natural oils and you will get hazelnut butter When the nuts have liquified add the sugar cocoa and vanilla Slowly drizzle in enough oil to make a spreadable consistency Since the mixture is warm it will be more fluid now than at room temperature Transfer the spread to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for 1 2 months For best results stir the chocolate hazelnut spread before using Chocolate Hazelnut Spread caramel base Caramel instructions adapted from Chocolate and the Art of Low Fat Desserts by Alice Medrich Yield about 12 ounces 1 1 2 cups 1 2 cup sugar1 4 cup water2 cups whole raw hazelnuts1 4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1 2 tsp vanilla extract1 8 tsp salt Preparation Line a baking sheet with foil Preheat oven to 350 F Make the caramel Combine the sugar and water in a 3 to 4 cup saucepan To prevent crystallization don t stir it again during the cooking Cover and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat Remove the lid and wipe down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush or a scrunched up paper towel dipped in water Cover and cook for 2 minutes or until the sugar s completely dissolved Uncover and cook until the syrup looks like pale amber maple syrup If your pan s dark and you can t gauge the color of the syrup spoon a drop or two onto a white saucer Swirl the pan gently continuing to cook and test the color until the syrup turns medium amber Immediately pour the caramel onto the lined baking sheet Tilt the sheet to spread the caramel as thinly as possible Let harden completely about 15 minutes Toast the nuts Meanwhile place the hazelnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet Toast in the oven until the skins are almost black and the meat is dark brown about 15 minutes Stir the nuts halfway through baking to ensure an even color To get rid of the bitter skins wrap the cooled hazelnuts in a clean kitchen towel or paper towel Rub until most of the skins come off but don t worry if some remain Make the nut butter When the caramel is completely cool break it into small pieces and pulverize in a food processor Try to get the caramel as fine as possible at this stage it won t get finer once you add the nuts Add the nuts and process until they have liquefied about 5 minutes Scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally Be patient the nuts will go from a fine meal to forming a ball around the blade to nut butter Add the cocoa vanilla and salt and process until smooth Transfer the spread to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for 1 2 months For best results stir the chocolate hazelnut spread before using Variations To make any standard nut butter use this procedure but omit the powdered sugar cocoa vanilla and extra oil Add 1 2 tsp salt and up to 2 tbsp granulated sugar Try making your own cashew butter you may never go back to peanut butter again Notes Please use whole raw nuts and toast them yourself to intensify the flavor Pre toasted or pre chopped nuts are often spoiled To further intensify the nut flavor use unrefined nut oil for version 1 which is tan in color Peanut oil is especially cheap in Chinese supermarkets 20 ounces for 2 38 So if you re looking for a gourmet ingredient try an ethnic market You really need a full sized food processor to make nut butter not a mini version or a blender I recommend a 7 cup Cuisinart it s large enough for most household tasks but isn t too bulky Resources Official Nutella siteNutella recipes homemade

[2020-06-25 21:30:56,705] [6466/MainThread] [INFO] [dataiku.doctor.prediction.classification_scoring] V=dummy:boilerplate:{"body":"   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Women may say, \"It's about time.\" Guys may have the same reaction. After many overly optimistic predictions, a male version of the Pill may truly be in sight. And a team at the University of Kansas School of Medicine, a nationally recognized center of research into male contraceptives, is working to be among the first to put a new generation of products on the market. Joseph Tash, a reproductive biologist at the Kansas school, has spent a decade tinkering with a chemical compound called H2-gamendazole that keeps sperm from developing in the testes. Men taking a gamendazole pill would essentially be shooting blanks. The expectation is that men on this pill would experience no change in their libido and, if they stopped taking it, would regain full fertility within a few weeks. Tash's work is part of a promising array of new birth control methods for men that are under development in laboratories or already being tested on volunteers. These contraceptives are arriving more than 50 years after the female birth control pill revolutionized relations between the sexes and gave women greater control over their lives. Outdated attitudes that birth control was women's work, along with the technical challenges -- women release just one egg per month, but men produce 1,000 sperm per second -- have slowed development of new male contraceptives. But recent investments in research appear to be paying off. Men already are testing contraceptives based on hormones that are analogous to the contraceptive pills women take. Meanwhile, researchers such as Tash are working on compounds that target sperm production or activity directly without affecting men's hormones. Tash is confident enough about gamendazole that he's getting ready to ask the Food and Drug Administration what additional studies he will need to do before he can start trying it on human subjects. \"We have enough data now to actually go to the FDA,\" he said. He will have to meet a high standard of safety for a drug that healthy men would be taking regularly for a long time. FDA approval, if it goes that far, is perhaps a decade away. So far, though, the compound's safety has checked out in rabbits, mice, rats and monkeys. Mating tests on rats showed no change in their behavior, Tash said. \"And it's 100% effective and 100% reversible.\" No formal mating tests on monkeys yet, but those that took it \"still seemed happy,\" he said. Will men take it?  The prospect of a male pill raises plenty of questions: Will men be willing to take it? Will women trust men to take it? Will it have any effect on the divisive issues of birth control? Contraception for men has long been limited to a small and dismal set of options -- condoms, vasectomy, interruption of intercourse. But that hasn't kept increasing numbers of men from shouldering responsibility for preventing unwanted pregnancies. Laura Lindberg of the Guttmacher Institute, which does research on reproductive health, traces this change in behavior to the 1980s, when more men started using condoms. The trend by couples to delay having children had begun, and that created a greater need for contraception. But not all women were able or willing to use contraceptive pills or intrauterine devices. Condoms became a regular part of marriages and long-term relationships. The '80s also was the era of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases; condoms became a routine part of safe sex. \"Condoms moved from behind the counter in the drug store to out front, and so did our attitudes,\" Lindberg said. In 1982, only 52% of sexually experienced women reported ever having had sex with a partner who used a condom. By 2006, it had climbed to 93% of women.    health,freep.com,detroit,michigan,news,local news,headlines,stories,world news  women may say, 'it's about time.' guys may have the same reaction.  women may say, 'it's about time.' guys may have the same reaction.

heart attack","title":"How Exercise Protects You from a Heart Attack ","body":"Researchers from Emory University School of Medicine University of Colorado at Boulder and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine decided to try to figure out exactly how exercise benefits the heart and why humans who exercise and have a heart attack have improved survival compared to non exercisers They found that a four week voluntary exercise program1 in mice protected them from experimental induced heart injury a benefit that was sustained for a full week following the last session of exercise It is well known that aerobic exercise activates the production of friendly nitric oxide eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide by activating the enzyme that helps make eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide endothelial nitric oxide synthase In turn the extra eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide helps the heart and circulation relax and blood to flow easier Interestingly the researchers found that eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide was converted by the heart and in circulation and stored as an eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide savings account eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide was attached to a protein via sulfur taking the form of nitrite and nitrosothiols This stored eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide could then be released out of the savings account as needed to help the heart or circulation function better even under stress Also of interest is that aerobic exercise activates fat burning almost immediately This study found that the activation of adrenalin receptors within white adipose tissue \u03b23 adrenergic receptors was essential for optimal eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide production and storage linking the health of white adipose tissue to the cardiovascular protective response of exercise Our study provides new evidence that nitric oxide generated during physical exercise is stored in the bloodstream and heart in the form of nitrite and nitrosothiols These more stable nitric oxide intermediates appear to be critical for the cardioprotection against a subsequent heart attack said senior author David Lefer PhD professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine There are several points to understand The endorphin anti inflammatory benefit from aerobic exercise tends to last about 48 hours assuming you are getting a good response to exercise This eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response is synergistic and different Once conditioned by regular aerobic exercise then a savings account of protective eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide builds up that appears to last for approximately 1 week if exercise is stopped Both anti inflammatory mechanisms are very important to your health This animal research showed that \u03b23 adrenergic receptors were essential for this eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response This study was not done using fat mice In overweight humans there is adrenalin resistance in white adipose tissue which is likely to blunt this healthy eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response in overweight people On the other hand as a person loses weight while exercising aerobically then the adrenaline resistance will go away and the cardioprotective eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide will be boosted This is yet another good reason to get in a weight loss mode if you are overweight It also means that if you are really out of shape you should begin your fitness gradually as the inability to activate these \u03b23 adrenergic receptors in white adipose tissue actually causes increased cardio stress from exercise You can use nutrition to help improve this scenario This can be done by anyone who wants to enhance the eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide response and would be especially important in someone trying to get themselves onto a good exercise program and build up a better state of fitness Nutrients such as grape seed extract and Resveratrol Natural phenol or type of antioxidant found in red grapes red wine Research has shown beneficial effects as anti cancer and anti inflammatory agents along with supporting healthy blood sugar and cardiovasculature function 2 are known to boost the activity of friendly eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide by activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase Nutrients such as N acetyl cysteine whey protein MSM sulfur and R alpha lipoic acid would all provide thiol related raw materials to help make the storage compounds for eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide Unfriendly and inflammatory nitric oxide iNOS Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase This enzyme influences genes located in the neuro immune and cardiovascular system and provides immune defense against pathogens and contributes to disease progression including neurogenic inflammation iNOS2 wreaks havoc in your body brain and cardiovascular system In order to be healthy you need to have more eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide than iNOS Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase This enzyme influences genes located in the neuro immune and cardiovascular system and provides immune defense against pathogens and contributes to disease progression including neurogenic inflammation iNOS2 A great way to boost up your eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Type of enzyme involved with various physiological signals and maintenance activities with nitric oxide supply is to exercise assuming you get a good response to that exercise Various nutrients can enhance your exercise response and may be very important especially for unfit people who are trying to get on a healthy path to recovering their fitness exercise, enos, inos, &#946;3-adrenergic receptors researchers from emory university school of medicine,

crunches don't work - newsweek","body":"Everyone knows that the road to flat tight abs is paved with crunches Lots and lots and lots of excruciating crunches Or is it As it turns out the exercises synonymous with strong attractive abs may not be the best way to train your core and may be doing damage to your back We stopped teaching people to do crunches a long long time ago says Dr Richard Guyer president of the Texas Back Institute That s because the full flex movement the actual crunch part of crunches puts an unhealthy strain on your back at its weakest point The section with the most nerves and most potential for nerve damage is in the back of the spine which is the very part that bends and strains during a sit up There are only so many bends or a fatigue life in your spinal disks says Stuart M McGill a professor of spine biomechanics at the University of Waterloo Inside each disk is a mucus like nucleus he says and if you keep flexing your spine and bending the disk over and over again that nucleus slowly breaches the layers and causes a disk bulge or a disk herniation A herniated disk won t show through your swimsuit but it s no fun and can cause persistent back and leg pain weakness and tingling Think of the oft repeated advice for movers bend at the hips and lift with your legs not your back And what is a sit up but a back bend done in a lying position When people are doing curl up over gym balls and sit ups and this kind of thing they are replicating a very potent injury mechanism on their back says McGill Every time they bend it they are one repetition closer to damaging the disk And of course when people do crunches they rarely stop at one or two in the quest for flat abs they ll churn out dozens at a time bringing them ever closer to flex intolerance so much pain and stiffness that it s difficult to tie one s shoes or bend down to pick a penny off the ground But who cares about back health as bathing suit season approaches Turns out crunches might not be the best solution for a flat stomach either That s because doing too many sit ups at the expense of other more comprehensive movements can lead to the dreaded aerobic abs That s the term celebrity trainer Steve Maresca coined to describe the distended stomachs of those who focus only on the rectus abdominus muscles targeted by sit ups and crunches They look great from the front but when they turn to the side their stomachs are extended he says To get the long lean look one needs to work transverse abdominius a large muscle that holds in those rectus abs and is mainly unchallenged by traditional ab work aka the sit up and crunches Doing a sit up doesn t train your ab muscles to do the job for which they were designed keeping your spine straight and secure and providing power for your movements In everyday life the abdominals are braces says McGill author of Ultimate Back Fitness and Performance Stuart McGill 2004 When doing any athletic movement even opening a door the spine is in a neutral posture not flexed and the abdominal muscles are contracted to brace the spine The best way for both your back and your beach body to work your midsection is to do movements that challenge the muscles to perform the way they re designed and expected to work in real life and not to train muscles in isolation It s important to have strong abs but strong abdominals are not the only thing says Dr Guyer You have your back extenders your flexors which are belly muscles you have your oblique muscles Working all of these muscle groups the anatomical association known as the core is essential to both back health and general athleticism As a result only training for good looking abs won t add to your athleticism or overall strength On the other hand moves not traditionally designed for good looking abs can in fact help strengthen and tone those muscles Consider the pushup Not usually thought of as a great ab move the pushup forces you to work several muscles at once it forces your core muscles to stabilize your trunk as your arms and back work to move the body up and down Do you see how a pushup is a full body challenge says McGill It challenges abdominals front of your legs your arms and your back That is how you use those muscles in real life Like the pushup the best exercises for back health and a firmer stomach are ones that work your abs while holding your spine straight like planks or leg drops done when you lie flat on your back with your hands at the base of your spine for added support Raise your legs up at a 90 degree angle then slowly lower until they re only inches from the ground Repeat until your stomach burns and you want to throw up And because your core is the center of power for most other exercises a long workout full of dynamic movements targeting legs arms and back also translates to a good core workout For more examples of effective ab exercises visit McGill s site backfitpro com Of course it won t matter how muscular your torso is if your body fat is too high The best way to build strong visible abs isn t through repeated sit ups but by engaging in circuit training that has you working your entire core while you re burning calories and to keep yourself disciplined during meals If you want to burn your fat mass make sure you have a combination of weight training and cardiovascular but 90 percent of good abs is your nutrition says Maresca However he does offer a quick tip for those of us with a weakness for caloric food standing up straight and pulling back your shoulders will instantly tighten your transverse abdominal muscle making you look a little leaner It s not quite as impressive as showcasing a well developed core via 10 percent body fat but it does leave a lot more

a good explosion When professional demolition experts bring down large buildings towers and bridges it usually draws a crowd Structures that took years to build can be reduced to rubble in a few

China the USA and South Africa Now 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 KaBOOM Let s watch some structures get blown up Atlanta Airport Control Tower 10 in the countdown an airport control tower that was no longer neededAugust 5 2006 the Atlanta Airport took down the FAA tower after it was replaced by the tallest airport control tower in the United States 3rd tallest in the world with a height of over 398 feet 121 m The construction of a fifth runway prompted the replacement because the old tower could not see the entire length of the runway The demolition created a giant plume of smoke that could be seen from miles away and the blast could be heard in downtown offices nine miles away 9 is a Chinese DamCould not find much info on this Chinese dam but they sure busted it up good with TNT 8 the Athlone Cooling TowersCape Town South AfricaOn Sunday 22 August 2010 a Cape Town landmark the Athlone Towers were demolished The event caused great excitement and drew record crowds on a dreary winter s day Media camera crews photographers and onlookers were caught off guard when the implosion detonated 4 minutes before the scheduled time The cooling towers were part of a coal fired generating station that was rendered obsolete when they realized it was cheaper to burn coal at the mine and transmit the power than to ship the coal to Cape Town to burn The failure of reinforcing rings on one tower hastened the implosion decision 7 the Trojan Nuclear Plant Cooling TowerPrescott OregonAt 7 00 am on May 16 2006 demolition experts demolished the 499 foot tall 152 m cooling tower at the Trojan Nuclear Plant on Oregon Equivalent to a 50 story building the cooling tower was visable from I 5 and therefore a major landmark The Trojan Nucular Plant was beset by design and construction flaws It also faced significant political pressure from Oregon residents who are decidedly anti nucular These factors lead to the shut down and destruction of the power plant just 16 years after opening and nearly 20 years before the expected initial designed life span Origional construction of Trojan commenced in 1970 with completion in late 1975 It cost 450 million to build the nucular power plant and another 230 million to dismantle it including continuing cost for storage of spent nuclear fuel 6 the Omega Radio Tower Trelew Argentina1 201 foot 5 inch tall structural steel tower is the tallest structure ever to be demolished using explosives It may not look like much in the video no flying concrete or dust like most of the explosions here but at over 1200 ft tall the Omega Radio Tower is an impressive demolition The tallest structure in South America was destroyed on June 23 1998 The OMEGA Navigation System was the first truly global radio navigation system for aircraft operated by the United States in cooperation with six partner nations Omega stations used very extensive antennas in order to transmit their extremely low frequencies Specifically they used grounded or insulated guyed masts with umbrella antennas or wire spans across fjords Omega antennas were built all along the world and they were the tallest constructions on the continent where they stood or still stand The Global Positioning System rendered OMEGA obsolete in 1997 and all stations ceased operation 5 on the KABOOM List 11 Story Retirement Home Gulfport MississippiDamaged by Hurricane Katrina the Armed

Kingdome said it was strong enough to last a thousand years Construction flaws unhappy sports teams and politics lead to a much quicker demise Just one day before the Kingdome s 24th birthday explosives were used to level the Kingdome in just 16 8 seconds The Kingdome was the world s largest thin shell concrete dome Taking the building down was recognized by Guinness World Records as the largest building by volume ever demolished by implosion It was the first large domed stadium to be demolished in the USA Kingdome debt lasted a lot longer then the actual building Ten years after the

hot 25 years ago","body":"18 April 2011 Last updated at 07 50 ET By Jason Palmer Science and technology reporter BBC News Superconductivity is a hundred years old this month and a way to make it accessible turned 25 this week But just how it does what it does remains a mystery even now Essentially it is the property exhibited by certain materials often at low temperatures to channel electrical current with zero resistance and very little power loss Imagine hitting a cue ball with a snooker cue and it never slowing down carrying on across the baize for years or forever In essence that was the promise of superconductivity a century ago when the phenomenon was first discovered by Dutch physicist Kamerlingh Onnes The charge carrying electrons travelling through the wires of your computer right now are bounced and slowed down by the vibrations of the atoms in the wires and by impurities in the metal that makes them up That is largely why computers get hot and why long distance power lines are inefficient that bouncing gets turned into useless heat With superconductivity those tortuous movements are removed electrons career through a material unimpeded because of the lack of electrical resistance However for decades after its discovery the effect was only seen at temperatures within 23 degrees of absolute zero temperatures that were available only in the most advanced labs So it was that superconductivity remained a textbook curiosity with an ever diminishing effort to make it happen at higher temperatures But then exactly 25 years ago a pair of researchers at IBM s Zurich research labs announced they had discovered a material that started to become superconducting at 35 degrees above absolute zero Model role There are not many occasions in history that a physics discovery makes a splash like the paper by Georg Bednorz and Alex Mueller The year following the discovery thousands of academic papers had been written on the topic of superconducting copper oxides and the discovery garnered the pair the very next year s Nobel prize in physics making it the shortest ever time between a discovery and recognition with a Nobel People still argue that the model we applied for our work was completely wrong said Dr Bednorz I m not so sure about that but if a model is suited to lead people into the right direction then the model has played its role he told BBC News Resistance free wires would be much more efficient so thoughts immediately ran to the idea of long distance transmission of electrical power We were very euphoric about that Dr Bednorz said Alex and myself started talking about transmission of electricity and high power transmission lines and we were immediately warned by some of our colleagues who said don t talk too much about this you ll be regarded as too optimistic and promising too much The principal problem then was that the team s copper oxide materials were brittle ceramics not amenable to being turned into wires But the push to make use of the first big superconductivity discovery in half a century proved too much despite initial hopes Big push Some of those people who warned us who were very sceptical changed their minds completely Dr Bednorz recalled A couple of months later I heard from one of these colleagues that he was leaving IBM and joining a startup company producing superconducting wires For the most part though the ease of cooling the materials to their useful temperatures only made existing applications more accessible Superconductivity has other effects such as the ability to exclude the force of another magnet causing it to levitate Cooled superconducting magnets also produce very strong magnetic fields Magnetically levitated trains had been demonstrated before 1986 as had the superconducting magnets that now form the basis for magnetic resonance imaging MRI Superconducting magnetic propulsion was considered and a ship was built in Japan in 1991 but the technology has gone no further Maglev trains have been built and decommissioned around the world in the intervening years and currently only Japan has a significant rail line that uses the technology But the delay in widespread use Dr Bednorz said was coming to an end if only because the energy efficient nature of so called High Temperature Superconductivity HTS materials made them a compelling choice I think with the dilemma we are facing at present with the energy crisis we have to save energy at every corner of our planet he said If we can reduce losses in transporting energy from A to B if we can produce more efficient machinery we need to do it Generation gap With three of his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT in Cambridge US Greg Yurek co founded American Superconductor in April of 1987 just a year after Bednorz and Mueller s landmark paper The company s first task was to as Professor Yurek put it find ways to bend the unbendable wire for application first of all in power transmission So where are they Until now short runs of these superconducting cables have featured in demonstration projects the first of which was switched on a decade ago in the US city of Detroit and international efforts have shown similar small scale successes You always think you can do it faster but if you look in the history of advances it takes about a generation to get from lab discovery to marketable option Professor Yurek told BBC News He noted that the optical fibres that criss cross the globe carrying data and even transistors experienced the same lag between discovery and widespread use He too though suggests that the green credentials of the approach mark it for wider adoption Over a 1000 km run superconducting cables can carry far more power than cables of a comparable size Even taking into account the energy required to cool them they lose just a third as much energy in transmission Just as in the case of optical fibres the technology has been quietly refined over the years and in some senses is ready to be deployed This will be costly at first but with tangible benefits that the wider market may just not yet be convinced of What would almost certainly push things along would be a material that becomes superconducting at much higher temperatures radically simplifying the cooling that wires motors and magnets in current HTS approaches require But the truth is 100 years after its discovery there is still no consensus view on how superconductors really work at a microscopic level Who knows whether there s yet another class of materials with a higher temperature to superconduct Whether that is a development that takes place in the next couple of years or never I can t predict Dr Bednorz said But as long as we don t have a really solid theory as for what s causing these materials to get into the superconducting state we cannot predict anything monday marks the 25th anniversary of the discovery that brought superconductivity out of the laboratory and toward practical applications.","url":"bbc co uk news science environment 13097371"} i=-0.0439854778953076

","body":"When I saw Wilton s Tasty Fill Heart Cake Set I knew that I wanted to try making one of the lovely heart centered cakes myself A cake with a heart shaped center is perfect Valentine s Day After I picked up the cake pan set all I needed to do was decide what flavor cake I wanted to make I decided to work backwards and knowing that I wanted a pink heart at the center of the cake I ended up opting for a very dark colored chocolate cake for the cake itself The cake pans come in a pair and you get the heart center when the two cakes are stacked on top of each other This cake recipe fits the pans perfectly and it rose up just to the top of them easily filling the cavities built in to the pans which produce the heart shape This is a recipe that I would ordinarily use to make two thick 8 inch cake layers There is a whole cup of cocoa powder in the cake so it has a really delicious chocolate flavor to it It is very moist and tender but is not too dense and is very easy to handle the cake it isn t too delicate or likely to crumble as you move the pieces around There is coffee in the cake to emphasize some of the cocoa notes but there is no coffee flavor to the finished cake just a lot of chocolate While I knew from the start that I wanted a pink filling the hardest part of making this cake was figuring out what that filling should be Ice cream is a good option but not great in the wintertime and many of the suggestions that came with the pan included Cool Whip which I didn t want to use I ended up making a very light raspberry mousse held together with a little bit of plain gelatin to give it stability It has a great raspberry flavor a beautiful color black raspberries will give you a more purple color regular will be lighter pink I used a mixture of both and a very light fluffy texture to it I used a pasteurized egg white beaten to soft peaks to give this mousse a lot of volume You can actually use meringue powder as a good substitution in this case if you can t get pasteurized eggs so I ve made notes about the substitution below The finishing touch for this cake is the cream cheese frosting on top The creamy frosting has a nice sweetness to it that goes well with the chocolate cake It also blends nicely with the bright raspberry flavor of the mousse You can use other berries for the filling strawberries blackberries etc and you can use either fresh berries or frozen defrosted berries This cake should be stored in the fridge to keep the mousse filling firm That said the cake must be stored in an airtight container to prevent the cake from becoming dry in the fridge This cake didn t disappoint me in any way It was delicious with a great cake a great combination of flavors and a finished product that looked just like the cake does on the box This is definitely a great treat for Valentine s Day and I like the pan enough that I m going to have to look for other excuses to have a cake with a heart shaped center around too Deep Chocolate

combined and no streaks of flour remain visible Divide evenly into prepared pans Batter should just cover the heart indents in each side of the Wilton pan cake will rise quite a bit during baking Bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean Allow cakes to cool in the pan for 10 minutes then loosen the side with a butter knife and turn cakes out onto

Coco Chanel ran a critical eye over her atelier one morning and declared These models look like housemaids on a day off she was probably close to the mark Modelling during the 1920s in and out of the studio was not yet a profession considered entirely suitable for girls from smart families At best it was a juvenile novelty at worst it was considered shameful or slightly provincial like taking to the stage As late as 1947 Barbara Goalen who was left to raise her children alone after her husband s death had wavered between taking in laundry and modelling the studio won and she became the British mannequin ne plus ultra of her day In the US Mary Mimsie Taylor s well to do parents had been appalled by her plea to model dresses for her favourite magazine but she was suffering from a blood disease and was not expected to survive her teens Cecil Beaton answered her letters to Vogue and she became an early favourite she lived to be 93 When British Vogue was launched in 1916 models were not credited In fact they often seemed to shy from view their faces hidden by wide brimmed hats heads tilted away or in some cases cut off altogether in favour of a fine lace trim This was after all the era in which a correspondent could report without irony on the spectacle of a young woman actually powdering her nose in the presence of the young man with whom she had just been dancing Models as we now know them finally began to see their names on the magazine s pages in the early 1920s For the most part they still had parallel careers cabaret singers as Chanel had once been although she kept it quiet or popular actresses of the day These were variety all rounders such as Betty Knox of the Wilson Keppel and Betty triple act and Lily Wood famous for her comedy songs Many of the great early models fell into the profession by accident Lud born Ludmila Feodoseyevna was spotted while delivering a parcel to the Vogue studios she got the wrong studio and ended up throwing it at the photographer Horst in a temper and became one of his favourite models Lee Miller stepped off a Manhattan sidewalk only to be pulled back from the path of a speeding car by Cond\u00e9 Nast owner of Vogue who thought her looks good enough for his magazine Long before models could launch their own nail varnish lines or bankroll restaurants they were still clever and adroit They were also fearless The Romanov princess Natalie Paley saw most of her family murdered before reaching the west Toto Koopman captured as an Allied spy survived Ravensbr\u00fcck to become a respected fixture of the Mayfair art world Even Lud once described as a lethally beautiful Medea survived her battles The favourite of both Elsa Schiaparelli and Coco Chanel who loathed each other she was pulled back and forth between the two of them until one day she upped and left modelling entirely Later it was heard that she had joined a travelling circus and married the lion tamer Daisy FellowesFellowes had the air of having just disembarked from a yacht one observer noted adding which she very likely had Rich and soign\u00e9e half French and half American the Hon Mrs Reginald Fellowes was considered the best dressed woman in the world She had editor Diana Vreeland said the elegance of the damned Born in 1890 as a young woman she was sketched by John Singer Sargent Her first brief marriage to Jean Prince de Broglie propelled her into the society pages Her second in 1919 to Reginald Fellowes a financier and cousin of Winston Churchill propelled her further The Hon Mrs Reginald Fellowes is the embodiment of the 20th century in the variety of her interests reported Vogue She is a noted sportswoman and author Mrs Fellowes s first book published recently is called Cats in the Isle of Man Marion MorehouseThe partnership of Edward Steichen and Marion Morehouse changed the course of fashion photography As chief photographer for Vogue and Vanity Fair Steichen propelled both titles into the age of modernism And they came no more modern and streamlined than model Marion Morehouse with her sleek head attenuated limbs and ramrod back all accentuated by Steichen s dramatic lighting At a stroke his predecessor Baron de Meyer s soft focus aesthetic looked outmoded and trivial Vogue s proprietor Cond\u00e9 Nast told Steichen Every woman de Meyer photographs looks like a model You make every model look like a woman According to Steichen Miss Morehouse was no more interested in fashion than I was But when she put on the clothes that were to be photographed she transformed herself into a woman who would really wear that gown or that riding habit That models became so recognisable that they began to fascinate the public is often traced back to Marion Morehouse And with justification She was not an actress or a society figure but something new entirely a dedicated model and Vogue began to use her name in credit lines Morehouse was equipped with a joie de vivre and a keen sense of adventure When Steichen suggested they do a series of experimental nude photographs she readily agreed On learning that she was married he destroyed the negatives to spare her any future embarrassment Natalie PaleyA granddaughter of Tsar Alexander II Princess Natalie Paley possessed few relatives who hadn t been murdered but was blessed with stunning good looks and the capriciousness of a thoroughbred In her husband Lucien Lelong s sculpted creations she became the focus of many of early fashion photography s greatest moments She was a daughter of Alexander II s eighth son Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia and half sister of Grand Duchess Marie and Grand Duke Dmitri the latter involved in the murder of Rasputin Her mother Olga was a commoner and her parents marriage scandalised the Romanov court When the Revolution broke out Grand Duke Paul and his family were placed under house arrest Eventually the princess s brother Vladimir a poet was thrown down a mineshaft with the Tsarina s sister and finished off with a hand grenade Six months after that Paley s father was shot The remaining family members escaped penniless to Finland they walked Perhaps as a result of her exile Paley felt she never truly belonged anywhere though she called Paris home Her marriage to Lelong was one of convenience and each kept their own circle of intimates Paley s appearances in Vogue gradually diminished but she never entirely disappeared from fashion circles For many years she was a public relations consultant to the US couturier Mainbocher She died in 1981 Toto KoopmanHalf Dutch half Chinese Catherina Toto Koopman was born in Java and educated in Holland and England By the 1920s she was in Paris making a living as a showroom model for Chanel and Marcel Rochas Of those early days she said It really was another world One dressed not to please men but to astound other women As well as modelling she tried her hand at acting and had a bit part in Alexander Korda s The Private Life of Don Juan 1934 After filming she stayed on in England where she had begun a short lived romance with Max Aitken son of Lord Beaverbrook who did everything he could to break it up Her war years are still mysterious she is believed to have worked as a go between for British intelligence in Italy Her cosmopolitan looks multilingualism and contacts in Venetian society would have made her a prized asset Eventually she was betrayed and on direct orders from Berlin sent to Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp For two years working in the camp s kitchens she displayed great bravery by smuggling out food to the starving inmates and intervened on behalf of prisoners selected for death After the war Toto Koopman returned to London and helped run the Hanover Gallery with her lover Erica Brausen another wartime heroine Together they nurtured the career of Francis Bacon among others giving him his first one man show in 1949 Maxime de la FalaiseAs early as 1949 the Comtesse Alain de la Falaise was according to Vogue a prompting spirit in Paris couture She was one of the earliest upper class women to sport a cropped gamine hairstyle while Cecil Beaton said of her Her limbs are so exaggeratedly elongated her nose so small her eyes so enormous that she looks like a fashion drawing come to life She was born Maxine Birley to the English society portraitist Sir Oswald Birley and Rhoda Pike a celebrated Irish beauty In Paris after the war de la Falaise modelled for Elsa Schiaparelli whose designs then enjoyed a brief renaissance and became a stylish vendeuse and ambassador for the label When it went into decline she worked for Christian Dior and also especially for Maison Paquin before it closed its doors in 1956 After her career in modelling she kept herself financially afloat her marriage to Count Alain de la Falaise had been brief and he wasn t rich by writing selling furniture and acting as a muse to Yves Saint Laurent Vogue Model The Faces of Fashion by Robin

own cheese at home much like other dairy products like yogurt is one of those things that while requiring some demystification and a few special ingredients can be done a lot more easily than you think In the case of mozzarella cheese one of my favorites can be done in less than an hour for the cost of little more than a gallon of milk It s a fun food science experiment one minute you have a pot of milk the next the beginnings of cheese and you get to eat the delicious results Let s get started Supplies Ingredients 1 gallon or larger I used my 6 quart stock pot stainless steel or other non reactive e g non aluminum non cast iron pot with lid dairy thermometer colander slotted spoon long knife rubber gloves optional but recommended cheese cloth optional but also recommended 1 gallon milk not ultra pasteurized If using raw milk and you aren t absolutely positively sure it is free of pathogens heat the milk to 145 degrees Farenheit and keep it there for 30 minutes to pasteurize it If using store bought milk be sure you go with regular pasteurized milk and not ultra pasteurized it ll say on the label as the latter has been heated to a very high temperature that destroys all the organisms you need to make cheese 1 1 4 cup cool chlorine free water If you don t have a water filtration system that removes chlorine for you you can get it at the grocery store 1 1 2 teaspoon citric acid 1 4 teaspoon or 1 4 tablet rennet 1 teaspoon cheese salt or salt substitute Optional but again recommended The last three ingredients can be had from anywhere that sells cheese making supplies I got mine in a kit from cheesemaking com but the ingredients aren t that hard to come by Photo credit Collin Dunn Turning milk to cheese Step 1 Dissolve the rennet in 1 4 cup of the cool chlorine free water stir it up and set it aside Step 2 Mix citric acid into the remaining 1 cup of water and stir until dissolved Step 3 Pour the milk into your pot Stir it continuously while adding the citric acid solution Step 4 Continue stirring the milk over medium heat until it reaches 88 degrees F Step 5 Remove the pot from the heat and slowly stir in the rennet solution stirring up and down for about 30 seconds Step 6 Cover the pot and leave it undisturbed for 5 minutes Photo credit Collin Dunn Curds Whey Step 7 Take off the lid and voila you should have the beginnings of cheese The curd solid will have separated from the whey liquid and the curd should look like custard with a clear separation If the curd is still too soft or milky give it a few more minutes to set If you have something that more closely resembles ricotta cheese you may have stumbled into some ultra pasteurized milk by mistake Time to start over sorry Photo credit Jocelyn Tutak Cutting the cheese Step 8 Cut the curd with the knife be sure that it s long enough to reach the bottom of the pot You want to create little cubes of curd so cut parallel lines about an inch apart at a 45 degree angle Since the goal is creating curd cubes you ll want to make four sets of cuts after the first set of slices rotate the pot 90 degrees and repeat until your one solid curd has been sliced and diced into a bunch of floating cubes Click the photo at left to see what it looks like when you re done Photo credit Jocelyn Tutak Heating the curds Step 9 Put your pot of curds and whey back on the stove and heat to 110 degrees F slowly stirring the curds Once you achieve 110 degrees take the pot off the stove while continuing to stir for another 2 to 5 minutes more time will equal a firmer cheese Photo credit Jocelyn Tutak Separating curds whey Step 10 Ladel the curds into the colander which I lined with some cheesecloth folding gently to help drain off the whey Repeat a couple of times until the curd begins to become more dense and less moist Keep as much of the whey in the pot as you can you ll need it Step 11 Once your curds are more or less one solid mass heat the leftover whey or a different pot of water if you got ahead of yourself and discarded your whey to 185 degrees F Put your curds back in the pot for 5 10 minutes and don your rubber gloves Photo credit Jocelyn Tutak Streching the curds Step 12 Remove the curds from the hot whey and stretch If they don t stretch like taffy and fall apart put them back in their bath they have to be about 135 degrees F to stretch Sprinkle the salt on as you stretch you might get a half dozen or so good pulls on it and continue stretching until it s cool The more you work it the firmer it will be so less stretching will equal a softer cheese I found that stretching roughly half of the curd at a time was a good workable amount Photo credit Jocelyn Tutak Great balls of cheese Step 13 Form your stretched cheese into pleasing shapes I chose balls the little one was the test to see if it was hot enough to stretch If you go with a round shape you can pull the edges up underneath to hide any seams and they ll sort of melt into themselves Other options Braids string cheese rolled logs the options are only bound by your imagination If you aren t ready to eat your new cheese right away give it a bath in ice water to cool it and store it in the refrigerator for two weeks Mine didn t make it that long I sliced it up and made a delicious caprese salad Happy cheese making More on making your ownCaprese Salad made with Home Made Fresh

have to but I beg you to make homemade salted caramel sauce It will change your life for the better We added fleur de sel to the caramel If you don t have fleur de sel you can use Maldon sea salt flakes A flaky salt works best because it melts in with the caramel When Whit was done with the caramel she let me have a taste creamy caramel with a hint of salt perfection I was tempted to skip the bars and just drink the jar of caramel sauce but I was trying to be on my best behavior since we had company The bars have a thick buttery crust a layer of spiced apples that get drizzled with the salted caramel sauce and a crumb topping When the bars were cool I cut them into squares and drizzled them with additional salted caramel sauce We served the Salted Caramel Apple Crumb Bars for

tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature cut into pieces1 cup heavy cream at room temperature1 tablespoon fleur de sel or Maldon sea salt flakes Apple Crumb Bars For the Apple Filling 5 cups peeled and diced apples I used Granny Smith 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\u00bd cup all purpose Gold Medal flour1 teaspoon cornstarch1 cup granulated sugar1 4 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon ground cinnamon1 4 teaspoon ground nutmeg1 4 teaspoon ground all spice For the crust 3 cups all purpose Gold Medal flour1 cup granulated sugar1 teaspoon baking powder1 4 teaspoon salt1 4 teaspoon cinnamon1 cup cold unsalted butter cut into small pieces1 egg lightly beaten1 2 teaspoon vanilla extract Directions To make the Salted Caramel Sauce 1 First make sure you have all of the ingredients ready Once you start the caramel sauce you have to pay close attention so you don t burn it To begin heat the sugar over medium high heat in the bottom of a heavy 2 3 quart saucepan When the sugar starts to melt start whisking the sugar The sugar will clump up but keep whisking It will continue to melt When the sugar is melted stop whisking You can swirl the pan to move the sugar around 2 Continue cooking the sugar until it reaches a deep amber color Make sure you watch the pan very closely This is where it is easy to burn the caramel You want the caramel to reach 350 degrees F If you are new to making caramel I suggest using a thermometer 3 As soon as the sugar reaches the dark amber color carefully add the butter Whisk until butter is melted 4 Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour in the heavy cream Whisk until cream is incorporated and caramel is smooth Whisk in the fleur de sel or Maldon sea salt flakes 5 Let the caramel sauce cool for about 10 minutes in the pan Pour the caramel into a large mason jar and cool to room temperature while you make the apple crumb bars This recipe makes 2 cups of caramel sauce You can store the leftover caramel sauce in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks To make the Apple Crumb Bars 1 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F Spray a 9 13 inch baking pan with cooking spray and set aside 2 For the apple filling place the diced apples in a large bowl and sprinkle with lemon juice Mix gently In a separate bowl whisk together flour cornstarch sugar salt cinnamon nutmeg and ground all spice Pour over the apples and carefully combine Set aside 3 For the dough in a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and cinnamon Cut in the butter with a pastry blender or by using your hands until butter is mixed in but you still have small chunks of butter Mix the egg and vanilla together Add into the flour and butter mixture and combine The dough will be crumbly Pat half of the dough into the prepared pan 4 Spread the apple mixture evenly over the bottom crust Drizzle about salted caramel sauce over the apple filling about 3 4 cup Crumble the remaining dough over the apple caramel layer and pat gently 5 Bake for 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown Cool completely on a wire rack Cut into squares Drizzle salted caramel sauce over the squares and serve Note you won t use all of the salted caramel sauce for this recipe

Recipe for Cancer ","body":"In January 2010 the KFC National Council Advertising Cooperative the group that reps U S franchisees decided to sue Kentucky Fried Chicken KFC to get control of the advertising strategy This came in the wake of poor sales second quarter revenue at American KFCs those open for a year or more decreased 7 percent 1 Many franchisees have voiced disapproval over a couple KFC decisions Last year the company introduced grilled chicken and the slogan Unthink KFC Recently however sales of grilled chicken have sunk according to Larry Starkey owner of seven KFC franchises Are people beginning to Unthink KFC and grilled chicken Carcinogen This month a medical non profit s lawsuit over a carcinogen found in grilled chicken is set to continue after a California appeals court reversed a ruling 2 Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine PCRM tested grilled chicken samples from several chain restaurants including ones from McDonald s The organization said in court filings that the tests found the presence of a carcinogenic chemical called PhIP which is produced through the cooking process used by the fast food chains So the committee filed suit saying that the restaurants are required to post warnings under a California law which stipulates that businesses cannot expose individuals to chemicals known to cause cancer without first giving clear and reasonable warning The restaurants countered that the state rule was preempted because such signage would contradict federal efforts to guarantee that food was cooked sufficiently to prevent the spread of food borne illness The restaurants all know that the grilled chicken has a cancer causing agent in them said Neal Barnard president of the physicians group They ought to share with you what they know McDonald s referred comment to the California Restaurant Association where spokesman Daniel Conway lambasted the charges of misleading consumers He said the levels of PhIP in grilled chicken didn t merit concern and that a proliferation of signs like the ones demanded in the suit would do nothing more than cause consumers to ignore warnings of greater consequence My biggest message is that grilled chicken is safe he said Bottom line But what do the scientists say This year about 562 340 Americans are expected to die of cancer more than 1 500 people a day 3 While thirty percent of cancers are caused by tobacco dietary factors also play a significant role in cancer risk At least one third of annual cancer deaths in the U S are due to dietary factors A recent review on diet and cancer estimates that up to 80 percent of cancers of the large bowel breast and prostate are due to dietary factors 4 Estimated Percentages of Cancer Due to Selected Factors 5 Diet 35 to 60 Tobacco 30 Air and Water Pollution 5 Alcohol 3 Radiation 3 Medications 2 Numerous research studies have shown that cancer is much more common in populations consuming diets rich in fatty foods particularly meat and much less common in countries eating diets rich in grains vegetables and fruits 6 While fruits and vegetables contain a variety of vitamins minerals antioxidants and phytochemicals to protect the body by contrast recent research shows that animal products contain potentially carcinogenic compounds which may contribute to increased cancer risk 7 Meat Meat naturally contains amino acids and a protein called creatine that is found in muscle tissue When meat is grilled this combination of amino acids and creatine form heterocyclic amines HCAs A major compound of HCAs is amino imidazo pyridines PhIP which is the compound found most abundantly in cooked meats 8 Meat need not be well done or charred to contain HCAs Testing has found HCAs in grilled chicken cooked for just three minutes on each side HCAs can pose a cancer risk even when consumed in small amounts No safe level of PhIP linked to several forms of cancer has been identified it appears to increase cancer risk even at very low levels 9 An analysis by Cancer Project Organization has revealed that grilled chicken has more than 10 times the amount of HCAs than grilled beef nearly all the HCAs detected were in the form of PhIP The table below lists the five foods containing the highest levels of HCAs The Five Worst Foods to Grill Food Item HCAs nanograms per 100 grams Chicken breast skinless boneless grilled well done 14 000 nanograms 100 grams5 Steak grilled well done 810 nanograms 100 grams6 Pork barbecued 470 nanograms 100 grams7 Salmon grilled with skin 166 nanograms 100 grams8 Hamburger grilled well done 130 nanograms 100 grams6 100 gram portion equals about 3 5 ounces grilled Vegetarian Foods The Cancer Project Organization recommends plant based foods which do not contain HCAs Because creatine is found in muscle tissue not in plant based foods vegetarian foods do not produce detectable levels of HCAs when they are grilled These healthful grilling options include soy based veggie burgers vegetable kebabs barbecued tofu and portabella mushroom steaks These foods are also low in fat and cholesterol They may be low in fat and cholesterol but are they safe to eat Arsenic To fight the boll weevil in the 1950s U S cotton growers spread a pesticide that contained arsenic An effective killer the pesticide was also used against the gypsy moth Yet it had an unexpected side effect the soil of the fields and forests where it was applied remains laced with low levels of arsenic 10 Arsenic can t be broken down to harmless by products It stays in the soil unless rain or irrigation water washes it into the groundwater or a plant like rice which is now farmed on the old cotton fields takes it up into its stems leaves and grains Some plants can draw arsenic and other metals into their leaves and stems at doses that would easily kill other plants Scientists call these plants hyperaccumulators Unfortunately some food plants particularly rice are also very good at drawing in arsenic from the soil In July 2008 scientists in Japan and the United Kingdom reported why rice mistakes arsenic for silicon which is essential 11 Silicon stiffens the rice stems and leaves keeping the plants from falling over or lodging when their seed heads get heavy It helps the rice plant grow stronger husks and also protects the seed against fungus Poultry Today poultry producers also use arsenic against parasites They have sometimes supplemented chicken feed with roxarsone a compound containing arsenic to control parasites and promote weight gain Most of this arsenic is excreted by the birds and then becomes mixed in with sawdust and other litter materials used in poultry houses Farmers then typically use the litter as a nutrient rich and free fertilizer for amending their crop soils 12 The use of organoarsenicals in the poultry industry primarily roxarsone has increased as the industry has grown Concentrations of roxarsone normally added to feed are relatively low between 45 and 90 g t 1 However in areas of intensive poultry production such as the Delmarva Delaware Maryland Virginia Peninsula the application of roxarsone derived arsenic to agricultural soils can be quite acute 13 In 2000 approximately 620 000 000 broilers were raised on the Peninsula resulting in an estimated annual load of arsenic to Delmarva soils of 26 000 kg from land application of poultry litter 14 Arsenic and Health Arsenic is a known human carcinogen Chronic exposure to arsenic contaminated water is an important public health hazard around the world including the United States with millions exposed to drinking water with levels that far exceed World Health Organisation WHO guidelines 15 Prenatal arsenic exposure in human populations has been associated with pronounced long term health consequences The evidence comes from studies of 32 mothers and their children in a province of Thailand that experienced heavy arsenic contamination from tin mining Similar levels of arsenic are also found in many other regions including the US Southwest 16 Leona D Samson Director of MIT s Center for Environmental Health Sciences CEHS and the American Cancer Society Professor in the Departments of Biological Engineering and Biology at MIT said We were looking to see whether we could have figured out that these babies were exposed in utero just by using the gene expression screening on the stored blood samples Samson says The answer was a resounding yes The gene expression changes the group found in the exposed children are mostly associated with inflammation which can lead to increased cancer risk Recognizing the damaging effects of the arsenic exposure the government has provided alternative water sources to the affected villages Arsenic contamination of the Ron Pibul drinking water is roughly the same as that known to be present in many of the western United States suggesting that prenatal arsenic exposure may also be a problem there 17 It may be a good idea to warn pregnant women of the dangers of eating grilled chicken accompanied by vegetables grown in Maryland or anywhere else that uses arsenic as fertilizer Bottom line Tags Arsenic Cancer carcinogen dietary factors and cancer

they are few and far between Most of them are pretty frustrating as laid out plans fall to nought like the day when the preteen woke up showered to go to school then looked pale and green Fever It was back to bed for him took care of the rest of my day Then late the same night I was reading the LA Times Food newsletter which always makes me hungry I love the Culinary SOS recipes and spent too much time lost in the pages What caught my eye was the Carpe Diem s Mexican chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me but I didn t have that many eggs in the larder for 6 egg yolks One thing led to another and I landed up at these Clementine s butterscotch brownies I knew instantly what I would be doing the next morning after making sure the lad was packed off to school It was fun doing these fuss free and simple like baking on the fast track It s a GREAT recipe These are GOOD you know exclaimed the not so terrible anymore teen I like the flavours the tinge of salt with the sweetness the caramel like feel to these Are these brownies They are called butterscotch brownies though I was tempted to call them blondies I got 16 pieces out of the batch nice slightly chewy as we like them with a pleasing depth in taste YUM They packed a neat bite Not sure how you toast your walnuts almonds etc but I now fast track that too in the microwave for 3 4 minutes Keep an eye on them give them a quick stir halfway through and they are toasted enough Cool and chop my Ergo chef knives work like a charm here By the time the oven was preheated the batter was ready and they baked in next to no time Later that day Mr PAB and me went out for a bit indulged whole heartedly in Indian street food then he obligingly took me to shop at the dusty little gypsies tents read very dusty I go there often you can see some more of my shopping on this guest post here Mr PAB is a man of patience I walked from one dusty tent to another from the side of my eyes I could see the car crawl along no pressure nothing NICE I bought a few battered wooden boxes rushed home dusted washed sun dried and oiled them Used one for the butterscotch brownies above The old gypsy who sold them to me was H A P P Y and rushed to get his hookah when I asked if I could take some pictures had my P S in my bag Look at him no pressure of the daily grind enjoying what he was doing making metal cheese graters by hand and ever so obliging And now over to Clementine s butterscotch brownies of which L A Food Times says Tender rich and temptingly sweet Clementine s butterscotch brownies balance that brown sugary goodness with a nice hint of salt
